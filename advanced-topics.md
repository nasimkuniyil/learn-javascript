- [ ] Custom promise wrappers
- [ ] Error recovery in async/await
- [ ] Throttling and debouncing

## 3. Design Patterns in JavaScript

- [ ] Factory pattern
- [ ] Module pattern
- [ ] Observer pattern
- [ ] Singleton pattern

## 4. JavaScript Internals

- [ ] Execution context and call stack
- [ ] Variable environment and lexical environment
- [ ] JavaScript memory model and garbage collection

## 5. Event Loop (In-depth)

- [ ] Job queue vs callback queue
- [ ] Task scheduling order (`setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `process.nextTick`)
- [ ] Animation frames (`requestAnimationFrame`)

## 6. Prototypes and Inheritance (Advanced)

- [ ] Prototype chain
- [ ] `__proto__` vs `prototype`
- [ ] Inheriting from built-in constructors

## 7. Meta-Programming

- [ ] `Proxy` and `Reflect`
- [ ] Intercepting operations with traps
- [ ] Use cases: validation, logging, etc.

## 8. Memory Management

- [ ] Garbage collection strategies
- [ ] Detecting and fixing memory leaks
- [ ] WeakMap and WeakSet

## 9. Event-Driven Architecture

- [ ] Custom event emitters
- [ ] Using `EventTarget` and `dispatchEvent`
- [ ] Real-world patterns for event-driven systems

## 10. Security in JavaScript

- [ ] Common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- [ ] Safe DOM manipulation
- [ ] Handling user input securely

## 11. Web APIs (Advanced)

- [ ] Fetch API with advanced options (headers, credentials, etc.)
- [ ] AbortController and signal
- [ ] WebSockets for real-time communication

## 12. Service Workers & Web Workers

- [ ] Running JavaScript in background threads
- [ ] Caching with service workers
- [ ] Message passing and limitations

## 13. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Lazy loading scripts and modules
- [ ] Debouncing expensive DOM operations
- [ ] Profiling with browser DevTools

## 14. Module Systems and Tooling
